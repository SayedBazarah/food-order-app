# Modalize

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize)

> ðŸš¨ **Warning** If you are using `expo`, the latest version makes the scroll/swipe behavior not usable. You need to use `"expo": "31.0.0"` and `"react-native": "https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-31.0.0.tar.gz"` to make it works properly. I will dig in to see what's the issue.

**This package is still in an early stage, use it with caution.** ðŸ––

A modal that loves scrollable content.

This component had been built with `react-native-gesture-handler` to address the common issue of scrolling, swipping and handling the keyboard behaviors, you can face with a modal with react-native. This component comes with a ScrollView, the default content renderer, a FlatList and a SectionList. They are all three built-in and make your life easier, just pass your content and Modalize will handle the rest for you.

It resolves the following issues:

- Swipping to dismiss Modalize
- Scrolling within a ScrollView
- Handling the keyboard automatically

## Installation

```bash
yarn add react-native-modalize
```

Check out [`react-native-gesture-handler`'s documentation](https://kmagiera.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started.html) to set it up.
